# pushkind-broker

pushkind-broker is a lightweight Rust 2024 daemon that exposes one or more
ZeroMQ `XSUB ⇄ XPUB` proxy pairs for Pushkind services. Each pair runs in its own
thread with configurable high-water marks, making it easy to fan messages out to
workers while keeping back-pressure under control.

## Features

- Multiple broker pairs defined via simple YAML/TOML/JSON configuration files.
- Per-socket high-water mark tuning to balance throughput and memory usage.
- Structured logging through `log`/`env_logger` for operational visibility.
- Graceful shutdown that zeros linger to avoid stalled sockets.
- Optional systemd unit (`pushkind-broker.service`) for production deployment.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs` — initializes logging, loads settings, and spawns threads.
- `src/config.rs` — loads `proxy.{yaml,toml,json}`, validates content, and
  defines the `Settings`/`Pair` types.
- `src/proxy.rs` — configures ZeroMQ sockets and calls `zmq::proxy`.
- `proxy.yaml` — sample configuration describing two broker pairs.
- `pushkind-broker.service` — hardened systemd unit file template.
- `Makefile` — `make check` helper that formats, lints, and tests.

## Configuration

At startup the broker searches for `proxy.yaml`, `proxy.toml`, or `proxy.json` in
the working directory (in that order). Each file should define at least one
pair:

```yaml
pairs:
  - name: emailer
    frontend: "tcp://127.0.0.1:5557"
    backend:  "tcp://127.0.0.1:5558"
    xsub_rcvhwm: 100000   # optional; defaults to 100_000
    xpub_sndhwm: 100000   # optional; defaults to 100_000
```

- `frontend` is the `XSUB` bind address that publishers connect to.
- `backend` is the `XPUB` bind address that subscribers connect to.
- `xsub_rcvhwm` / `xpub_sndhwm` set ZeroMQ high-water marks and default to
  `100_000` when omitted.
- Use the `name` field to label log lines for easier troubleshooting.

A configuration with no pairs is rejected to prevent accidental no-op runs.

## Running Locally

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Set `RUST_LOG=info` (or another level) to adjust log verbosity. The broker
inherits its working directory; ensure the desired `proxy.*` file is present or
set the `PWD` appropriately before launching under a supervisor.

## Development Workflow

```bash
make check             # fmt + clippy + tests
cargo build --all-targets --verbose
cargo test  --all-targets --verbose
```

The crate uses `tempfile` for configuration tests; add new cases alongside the
modules they exercise and keep panics out of production paths.

## Deploying with systemd

The repository includes `pushkind-broker.service` as a starting point. Customize
the `WorkingDirectory`, `ExecStart`, and security hardening directives to match
your environment before installing the unit.
